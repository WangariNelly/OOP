### OOP- object oriented Programming.
   ## Basics of OOP
OOP is a programming style based on classes and objects.
1. Class - its like a template for an object.
2. Object - is an instance of a class
   Objects have both properties( what they are made up of) and methods(what they do).
We have diffrent properties and methods on each object type. For the primitive types ie strings,booleans etc ,we call the diffrent properties and methods onthe primitive types to  convert them into objects or methods eg String.
### Principles of OOP that apply when Designing a class.
1. Abstraction - Hiding certain details that dont matter to the user and only showing features that are essential.
2. Encapsulation - Keeping properties and methods private to a class to avoid accidental manipulation of methods and properties from other classes.
3. Inheritance - reuse and extend the functionalities of the superclass( parent class).
4. Polymorphism - Having diffrent forms, Can override parent class. Same method name behaving diffrently depending on the type of object its called on.
